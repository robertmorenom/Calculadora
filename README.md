We have a basic calculator that has a menu of 6 options, where first we must type 2 numbers, after that, we get a small menu explaining each operation that the calculator can perform, there you decide which operation you want to perform by indicating a number from 1 to 6. Among these are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, change of values and finally an option to exit when you have done all your necessary operations.
